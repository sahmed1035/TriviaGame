## Getting Started

This game utilizes array, time intervals, and objects. 

## Built With

* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* HTML5


## Running the tests

Trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
* If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, it shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
